# Material Card blog

Built with Jekyll, this blog theme uses Google's [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io) framework. Its primary aim is to be fast, responsive and light. With all external resources minified and gzipped, the homepage weighs under 500KB and loads near instantly while maintaining a beautiful design. Subsequent page loads will be faster.

# Variables for post
Every page or post can be configured to use custom colors and authors. The variables used for this are defined in each post's front matter. `color` is for the background color, `textcolor` and `author` are self explanatory. You can also use `title`, and `date` to override defaults set by the post's filename. Jekyll supports more variables but these are the only ones currently implemented.

As for usage, here's an example front matter that you will prefix a blog post with.

```markdown
---
layout: post
color: "#dead00"
textcolor: white
author: Google
---
```
